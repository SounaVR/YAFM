# 📁🗄️ YAFM (Yet Another File Manager)

I know that similar applications exist, but I like to embellish my [portfolio](https://souna.lexod.fr/projects) ✨

This app lets you list your files by extensions via categories that you can reorganize/modify/delete and add to!
They're also organized by color, so you can find your files at a glance!
You can also interact with your files: left-click to open the file, right-click to open the file location :o

That's pretty much it, have fun 😃
